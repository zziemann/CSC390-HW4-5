Assignment 4,5

1. How long did you spend on this assignment?
 - I hoped this class would get easier as I went on, but it was still very difficult
(as an upper level Stanford CS class).  These two assignments, like the past ones, 
also took days to complete each.  

2. Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
A

3. Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
A

4. Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, 
along with an explanation of how you attempted 
to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.

 - These were definitely the hardest assignments. 
 - They are again combined because they directly build off each other. 
 - Note that the Twitter Framework I used didn't push from xcode but its the stuff from Stanford's website, unchanged. 
The disconnect of not having any background with Stanford classes seemed to come into play here.
However all things being considered I was able to get it working mostly.
Also I found myself struggling to simply understand basic Twitter concepts in these assignments 
(because I didn't have Twitter until this class forced me to).

The app can search Twitter based on the keyword you type in.
Once you click on a Tweet-result, it goes to the mentions page with the stats and data working nicely.
Also there is the tab view that you can switch to and view your recent searches, and then get data based off those searches.
Other smaller features like cell design also work.
I had some problems with CoreData loading in one part for assignment 5.
Sometimes I noticed the navigation acted very strange, but didn't seem consistent.
